<p>Godot Engine is a not-for-profit, community-driven free and open source project. It is legally represented by <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>,
a USA-based charity that helps promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects.</p>

<h2>User and company donations</h2>

</ul>

<p>You can donate monthly via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/godotengine">Patreon</a>, or directly via Paypal.</p>

<h3>Patreon</h3>

<p>Patreon is a platform for creators to crowdfund their work via monthly donations. Godot Engine launched a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/godotengine">Patreon page</a> with the aim to collect enough money each month to hire some of its developers part or full time, starting with its lead developer Juan Linietsky.</p>

<p>The Patreon donations are processed by Conservancy, which then uses them to hire developers based on contracts made transparent to all supporters.</p>
