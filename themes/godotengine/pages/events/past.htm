		<h3>FOSDEM 2018</h3>

		<p><a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> stands for Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting and is held every year in February at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Brussels, Belgium.
		It is arguably the biggest European event about free and open source software, with free entry and thousands of developers and users of various projects attending.</p>

		<ul>
	    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 3 & 4 February 2018</li>
	    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium (<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.81474&mlon=4.38164#map=17/50.81474/4.38164">OpenStreetMap</a>)</li>
	    <li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> Free</li>
	    <li><strong>Registration:</strong> No registration needed, you can just show up at our stand and say hello, but we'd be glad if you would <a href="https://framaforms.org/registration-for-godotcon-2018-1512567025">fill this form</a> anyway so that we know who to expect: <a href="https://framaforms.org/registration-for-godotcon-2018-1512567025">https://framaforms.org/registration-for-godotcon-2018-1512567025</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Godot stand (with goodies!)</h4>

		<p>Like last year, we will have a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/stands/">Godot Engine stand</a>. It will be located in Building K (<a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/buildings/#k">Campus plan</a>, <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.81474&mlon=4.38164#map=17/50.81474/4.38164">OpenStreetMap</a>).
		We invite all Godot users and contributors from Europe and beyond to join us there and help us man the stand, distribute goodies and talk to the other visitors about our engine.</p>

		<h4>Meeting the community</h4>

		<p>The primary purpose for many of us will be to meet each other in person after having worked for months or even years together online.
		We will have plenty of time to grab some Belgian beers together, and maybe organize a community dinner together on Saturday evening.</p>

		<p>Our lead dev Juan Linietsky (from Buenos Aires) will also be present, so don't miss this opportunity to meet him in Europe :)

		<h3>GodotCon 2018</h3>

		<img src="/storage/app/media/events/godotcon-2018/godotcon_banner_2018.png" alt="GodotCon 2018 banner" height="320px">

		<p>After last year's big success, we organize another GodotCon right after FOSDEM, and still in Brussels so that you can attend both events at once.
		GodotCon is the yearly meetup of the Godot Engine community, open to all interested users and contributions, whether complete beginners/new users or core developers.</p>

		<p>The entrance is free, and we will have various talks and workshops prepared by contributors and users of the engine, as well as different related activities.
		The main point is to all meet together with our laptops and hack at some Godot games or the engine itself, while getting to know the community in person and learn from experienced users.</p>

		<p>Our lead developer Juan Linietsky will come from Argentina for the event, so it's a great opportunity for Godot users in Europe to meet him!</p>

		<p>To spread the word about the event, you can use the <a href="/storage/app/media/events/godotcon-2018/godotcon_banner_2018.png">GodotCon 2018 banner</a> as well as print out the <a href="/storage/app/media/events/godotcon-2018/godotcon_poster_2018.png">GodotCon 2018 poster</a>.

		<h3>GodotCon Europe 2017</h3>

		<p>Behind the pompous name of <em>GodotCon</em> (short for Godot Convention), you will mostly find the first official IRL (*in real life*) meetup of the Godot community.
		We decided to organize such an event right after the FOSDEM so that people coming to Brussels for the former can also stay a bit longer for GodotCon.</p>

		<p>The entrance will of course be free, and the form that the event will take exactly will mostly depend upon the users and contributors who will be motivated in helping organizing it.
		The base plan is: we have a venue in Brussels, do Godot stuff there, and enjoy ourselves.</p>

		<ul>
		    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Feb 6 and 7, starting at 9 am</li>
		    <li><strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://hsbxl.be">Hackerspace Brussels (HSBXL)</a>, Brussels, Belgium (<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.84787&mlon=4.32847#map=19/50.84787/4.32847">OpenStreetMap</a>)</li>
		    <li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> Free</li>
		    <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Please <a href="http://framadate.org/godot-fosdem-godotcon-2017"=>fill this form</a> so that we know who will be there and can organise the event accordingly (it's different if we are a dozen or 40): <a href="http://framadate.org/godot-fosdem-godotcon-2017">http://framadate.org/godot-fosdem-godotcon-2017</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Schedule</h4>

		<p>There is no precise plan as of yet, but various things have been mentioned during community discussions.
		Extending upon the above base plan, the idea is that some of us organize talks, crash courses, workshops, etc. for all to benefit from and learn together.
		The topics will include some advanced tips and tricks about using the engine, presentation and knowhow transfer from various published or WIP projects, etc.
		If there is interest, we also consider having hacking sessions regarding developing the engine or writing documentation, so that we can strengthen the community of co-developers.</p>

		<p>More details on all this in the coming weeks, but the TL;DR is: It will be cool and will be tailor-made for the attendants, so join us!</p>
