		<h3>Meet the Nodes, Paris</h3>

		<img src="/storage/app/media/events/meetthenodes_paris2017.png" alt="Meet the Nodes banner" height="400px">

		<p>We are organising a Godot-focused event in Paris, France, on Saturday 22 April 2017. Many Godot developers and users will be there, including our lead dev Juan Linietsky (reduz).
		The event will take place at the Mozilla Space in Paris (address below), from 9 am up to approximately 7 pm (no big keynote should be after 5 pm though).</p>

		<p>The event will be partly talks from Godot developers about their current projects, engine features, etc., as well as workshops. Both curious beginners and experienced developers should find something interesting to work on, be it discovering the engine and make a simple game or hacking at the engine code and developing new features.</p>

		<h3>FOSDEM 2017</h3>

		<p><a href="http://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> stands for Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting and is held every year in February at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Brussels, Belgium.
		It is arguably the biggest European event about free and open source software, with free entry and thousands of developers and users of various projects attending.</p>

		<ul>
		    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Feb 4 and 5</li>
		    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium (<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.81268&mlon=4.37996#map=18/50.81269/4.37996">OpenStreetMap</a>)</li>
		    <li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> Free</li>
		    <li><strong>Registration:</strong> No registration needed, you can just show up at our stand and say hello, but we'd be glad if you would <a href="http://framadate.org/godot-fosdem-godotcon-2017">fill this form</a> anyway so that we know who to expect: <a href="http://framadate.org/godot-fosdem-godotcon-2017">http://framadate.org/godot-fosdem-godotcon-2017</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Godot stand (with goodies!)</h4>

		<p>This year will be Godot's first official participation with a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/stands/">Godot Engine stand</a>. It will be located in Building H (<a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/buildings/#h">Campus plan</a>).
		We invite all Godot users and contributors from Europe and beyond to join us there and help us man the stand, distribute goodies and talk to the other visitors about our engine.</p>

		<p>Want to help us with the stand, designing or ordering goodies and stand material (table cloth, kakemono, etc.)? Get in touch with us on <a href="/community">one of the community channels</a> (especially IRC ;)).

		<h4>Escoria talk in the Open Game Development track</h4>

		<p>Julian Murgia (StraToN) and Rémi Verschelde (Akien) will be giving a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/ogd_escoria/">25 min talk about Godot and particularily Escoria</a>, the Godot-based open source framework for point'n'click adventure games <a href="/article/our-point-click-framework-finally-out">that was released recently</a>. For those who can't attend, the talk should be recorded by FOSDEM volunteers and available online as soon as possible (can take a few weeks though).

		<ul>
		    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Sunday, Feb 5 @ 16:30</li>
		    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Room AW1.126 (come early, places are limited)</li>
		    <li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/ogd_escoria/">FOSDEM abstract</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Meeting the community</h4>

		<p>The primary purpose for many of us will be to meet each other in person after having worked for months or even years together online.
		We will have plenty of time to grab some Belgian beers together, and maybe organize a community dinner together on Saturday evening.</p>

		<h3>GodotCon Europe 2017</h3>

		<p>Behind the pompous name of <em>GodotCon</em> (short for Godot Convention), you will mostly find the first official IRL (*in real life*) meetup of the Godot community.
		We decided to organize such an event right after the FOSDEM so that people coming to Brussels for the former can also stay a bit longer for GodotCon.</p>

		<p>The entrance will of course be free, and the form that the event will take exactly will mostly depend upon the users and contributors who will be motivated in helping organizing it.
		The base plan is: we have a venue in Brussels, do Godot stuff there, and enjoy ourselves.</p>

		<ul>
		    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Feb 6 and 7, starting at 9 am</li>
		    <li><strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://hsbxl.be">Hackerspace Brussels (HSBXL)</a>, Brussels, Belgium (<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.84787&mlon=4.32847#map=19/50.84787/4.32847">OpenStreetMap</a>)</li>
		    <li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> Free</li>
		    <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Please <a href="http://framadate.org/godot-fosdem-godotcon-2017"=>fill this form</a> so that we know who will be there and can organise the event accordingly (it's different if we are a dozen or 40): <a href="http://framadate.org/godot-fosdem-godotcon-2017">http://framadate.org/godot-fosdem-godotcon-2017</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Schedule</h4>

		<p>There is no precise plan as of yet, but various things have been mentioned during community discussions.
		Extending upon the above base plan, the idea is that some of us organize talks, crash courses, workshops, etc. for all to benefit from and learn together.
		The topics will include some advanced tips and tricks about using the engine, presentation and knowhow transfer from various published or WIP projects, etc.
		If there is interest, we also consider having hacking sessions regarding developing the engine or writing documentation, so that we can strengthen the community of co-developers.</p>

		<p>More details on all this in the coming weeks, but the TL;DR is: It will be cool and will be tailor-made for the attendants, so join us!</p>
