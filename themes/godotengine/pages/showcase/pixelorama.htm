  support. It is made entirely with the Godot Engine. Current features as of
  version v0.8:

<ul>
  <li>Choosing between 7 tools – pencil, eraser, fill bucket, lighten/darken, color picker, rectangle select and zoom– and mapping them to both of your left and right mouse buttons.</li>
  <li>Are you an animator? Pixelorama has its own animation timeline just for you! You can work at an individual cel level, where each cel refers to a unique layer and frame. Supports onion skinning, cel linking, motion drawing and frame grouping with tags.</li>
