  <i>"The world hasn't ended yet."</i>
</p>
<p>
  Mark, an average irresponsible high school student, tries to get by and find
  purpose in a humdrum life of scrolling, cramming, and traffic. He meets
  friends, both old and new, and embarks upon a seemingly never-ending trouble,
  until nothing is ever the same again.
</p>
<p>
  Until Then is a contemporary story game inspired by the Philippines, its
  lifestyle, and culture. Featuring a smartphone where mechanics of modern
  living come into play, chat with your classmates, browse the web, and explore
  the depths of social networks.
