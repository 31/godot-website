<p>
  Gravity Ace is a 2D multi-directional gravity shooter (cave-flyer). It's a
  love letter to Thrust and Gravitar and all of the amazing games they inspired.
  Descend into dark caverns, fly and blast your way past enemies, retrieve the
  reactor core and make your escape, all while fighting the deadly embrace of
  crushing gravity.
