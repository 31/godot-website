<p>
  Build a hive, make some honey! Hive Time is a small, bee themed
  management/base building sim. Harvest resources, grow your hive, and produce a
  new Queen before the current one dies. Manage different bee roles in a totally
  scientifically inaccurate depiction of hive dynamics. Send Foragers out to
  find pollen and nectar, have Builders research new cell types, and ensure you
  have enough Beesitters to raise the next generation of bees. Make interesting
  choices that affect the hive - respond to wasp attacks, deal with outlaw
  slugs, or help a caterpillar realise a lifelong dream.
