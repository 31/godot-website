<ul>
  <li>
    Assume control over Basenji, a recently democratized Middle Eastern republic.
    As the president, you must juggle the demands of the voters while developing
    the nation economically. Oh, and don't forget your council of ministers, many
    of whom are entirely loyal to you... if only you knew which ones.
  </li>
  <li>
    Features dynamically generated neighbors, ministers, and economic and
    political considerations.  Find a dirty bomb, stop a meteor strike, address a
    global pandemic... no two playthroughs will ever be the same, and each run can
    unlock new content as you stay in power longer. The coup is coming: can you
    keep your wits about you and hold onto the presidency?
  </li>
  <li>
    Steer the country in any manner you choose. Hundreds of events and an insane
    number of policies make every experience unique to the player.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We love how Godot's scene structure emphasizes getting things done quickly and
  flexibly. Writing editor plugins and custom nodes is very useful, and if there
  is ever something that we want to tackle that it's in the main branch, there
  is nothing stopping us from cracking the thing open and building our own
  solutions to whatever problems we might encounter.
