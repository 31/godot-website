<p>
  Foremost, Godot is <abbr title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr>.
  It entails freedom to dispose of my game projects as I best see fit without
  worrying about the intricacies of software licenses. And while learning to use
  it, I realized it already had the necessary set of tools to pull out my game
  ideas. The node architecture with the concept of scene within scenes and the
  straightforward way of scripting with GDScript sealed the deal for me.
