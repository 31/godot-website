<ul>
  <li>
    Take control of the United States or Soviet Union and provide technical and
    economic assistance to guerrillas all over the world fighting for your
    cause, all while avoiding a direct and open-confrontation with the enemy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Subterfuge is the most important strategy. Safeguard your closest allies and
    change unfavorable regimes without giving away your long-term ambitions.
    Every action risks an enemy reprisal, and if nobody backs down from a
    standoff, we all lose.
  </li>
  <li>
    Face a highly-responsive, unpredictable AI that will attempt to understand
    your strategy and counter it at every turn.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hotseat play and online multiplayer play available.
  </li>
  <li>
    World leaders from 72 countries realized as animals native to the region,
    all pawns in the dangerous game of nuclear chicken.
  </li>
  <li>
    Manage resources from territories under your control to resolve immediate
    crises or win over future allies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recreate history, or forge your own path. Put a bear on the moon. The
    possibilities are endless with simple, intuitive gameplay that is
    simultaneously difficult to master.
  </li>
