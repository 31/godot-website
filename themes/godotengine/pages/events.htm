    <h3>FOSDEM 2020</h3>

    <p><a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> stands for Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting and is held every year in February at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Brussels, Belgium. It is arguably the biggest European event about free and open source software, with free entry and thousands of developers and users of various projects attending.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Date:</strong> Sat 1 & Sun 2 February 2020</li>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.81474&mlon=4.38164#map=17/50.81474/4.38164">OpenStreetMap</a>)</li>
      <li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> Free</li>
      <li><strong>Registration:</strong> No registration needed, you can just show up at our stand and say hello :)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will have a Godot stand at the event, with many engine contributors and users available to discuss with visitors and showcase the engine.
    We'll also have Godot T-shirts to sell, and stickers and metal pins to give away.</p>

    <p>Some of us also organize the Game Development devroom, where talks will be given on Sat 1 February on various topics related to both game development and Free and Open Source Software. Some talks will be about Godot, but many others will cover different technology stacks and projects.</p>

    <p>Refer to the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020">FOSDEM 2020</a> website for more information on which projects will be there, as well as talks that you might be interested in. (Note: The final schedule for FOSDEM usually arrives quite late, so be patient. :))</p>

    <p>Like the past few years years, we're taking the opportunity that many community members flock to Brussels for <a href="#fosdem">FOSDEM 2020</a> to organize our own <em>Godot Conference</em> right after it. There will be talks and workshops given by engine users and developers, and plenty of time to discuss with each other and play Godot-made games.</p>

    <p>A Call for Proposals <a href="/article/meet-community-fosdem-and-godotcon-2020">has been posted</a>, and speakers will be announced in January.</p>

    <p>This is an event for you (and us) to meet together and get to strengthen the existing bonds between Godot contributors and users. Everyone is welcome to join, and the entrance will be free. Even if you aren't familiar with Godot Engine yet, this can be a nice opportunity to discover a great game engine and an even greater community!</p>

    <img src="/storage/app/media/events/godotcon-2019/godotcon_poznan_banner_2019.png" alt="GodotCon Poznań 2019 banner">

    <p>Like last year, we organize a two-day event for all Godot Engine users and curious game developers.</p>

    <p>Similar to the event we also organize each February in Brussels, GodotCon Poznań is an event for all Godot community members, both curious newcomers and power users, to meet other users and contributors to the engine and exchange knowledge and experience. We typically have talks and workshops during the two days, and those who wish so also hang out together for dinner in the evenings.</p>

    <p>Our event is graciously hosted as a side event of the <a href="https://gic.gd">Game Industry Conference</a>, which will start with a nice party on the last evening of the GodotCon (October 17). The venue will be the <a href="https://www.mtp.pl/en">MTP Poznań Expo</a>, which is located centrally in the city and is also the venue for the (much bigger) GIC and PGA events.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in meeting fellow Godot users and many of the engine's core contributors, we strongly recommend that you join us at GodotCon. Last year was a lot of fun, and we expect this new edition to be even better :)</p>

    <p>This is an event for you (and us) to meet together and get to strengthen the existing bonds between Godot contributors and users. Everyone is welcome to join, and the entrance will be free. Even if you aren't familiar with Godot Engine yet, this can be a nice opportunity to discover a great game engine and an even greater community!</p>
