		<h3>fosdem 2018</h3>

		<p><a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> stands for Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting and is held every year in February at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Brussels, Belgium.
		It is arguably the biggest European event about free and open source software, with free entry and thousands of developers and users of various projects attending.</p>

		<ul>
	    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 3 & 4 February 2018</li>
	    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium (<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.81474&mlon=4.38164#map=17/50.81474/4.38164">OpenStreetMap</a>)</li>
	    <li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> Free</li>
	    <li><strong>Registration:</strong> No registration needed, you can just show up at our stand and say hello, but we'd be glad if you would <a href="https://framaforms.org/registration-for-godotcon-2018-1512567025">fill this form</a> anyway so that we know who to expect: <a href="https://framaforms.org/registration-for-godotcon-2018-1512567025">https://framaforms.org/registration-for-godotcon-2018-1512567025</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Godot stand (with goodies!)</h4>

		<p>Like last year, we will have a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/stands/">Godot Engine stand</a>. It will be located in Building K (<a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/buildings/#k">Campus plan</a>, <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.81474&mlon=4.38164#map=17/50.81474/4.38164">OpenStreetMap</a>).
		We invite all Godot users and contributors from Europe and beyond to join us there and help us man the stand, distribute goodies and talk to the other visitors about our engine.</p>

		<h4>Meeting the community</h4>

		<p>The primary purpose for many of us will be to meet each other in person after having worked for months or even years together online.
		We will have plenty of time to grab some Belgian beers together, and maybe organize a community dinner together on Saturday evening.</p>

		<p>Our lead dev Juan Linietsky (from Buenos Aires) will also be present, so don't miss this opportunity to meet him in Europe :)

		<h3>GodotCon 2018</h3>

		<img src="/storage/app/media/events/godotcon-2018/godotcon_banner_2018.png" alt="GodotCon 2018 banner" height="320px">

		<p>After last year's big success, we organize another GodotCon right after FOSDEM, and still in Brussels so that you can attend both events at once.
		GodotCon is the yearly meetup of the Godot Engine community, open to all interested users and contributions, whether complete beginners/new users or core developers.</p>

		<p>The entrance is free, and we will have various talks and workshops prepared by contributors and users of the engine, as well as different related activities.
		The main point is to all meet together with our laptops and hack at some Godot games or the engine itself, while getting to know the community in person and learn from experienced users.</p>

		<p>Our lead developer Juan Linietsky will come from Argentina for the event, so it's a great opportunity for Godot users in Europe to meet him!</p>

		<p>To spread the word about the event, you can use the <a href="/storage/app/media/events/godotcon-2018/godotcon_banner_2018.png">GodotCon 2018 banner</a> as well as print out the <a href="/storage/app/media/events/godotcon-2018/godotcon_poster_2018.png">GodotCon 2018 poster</a>.
