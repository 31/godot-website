		<h3>Godot Sprint Brussels 2019</h3>

		<p>The two days before <a href="#fosdem">FOSDEM</a> and <a href="#godotcon">GodotCon</a>, we organize our first Godot Sprint, with the intent for contributors to meet IRL and <em>get some work done</em>! This contributor sprint will be primarily intended for existing engine and documentation contributors, so that we can work on current topics together, review Pull Requests, discuss the roadmap, etc. We will also welcome users who aren't contributors yet but would like to get involved, be it with C++ engine contributions, documentation writing or the creation of other teaching materials (demos, courses, etc.).
		
		<p>Entrance will be free.</p>

		<h3>FOSDEM 2019</h3>

		<p><a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> stands for Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting and is held every year in February at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Brussels, Belgium. It is arguably the biggest European event about free and open source software, with free entry and thousands of developers and users of various projects attending.</p>

		<ul>
	    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 2 & 3 February 2019</li>
	    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium (<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.81474&mlon=4.38164#map=17/50.81474/4.38164">OpenStreetMap</a>)</li>
	    <li><strong>Entrance fee:</strong> Free</li>
	    <li><strong>Registration:</strong> No registration needed, you can just show up at our stand and say hello :)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We will have a Godot stand at the event, with many engine contributors and users available to discuss with visitors and showcase the engine.
		We'll also have Godot T-shirts to sell and stickers to give away.</p>
		
		<p>We also proposed some talks, but we're awaiting a confirmation from FOSDEM organizers. We'll update this page as soon as we know more.</p>

		<p>Refer to the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019">FOSDEM 2019</a> website for more information on which projects will be there, as well as talks that you might be interested in. (Note: The final schedule for FOSDEM usually arrives quite late, so be patient. :))</p>

		<h3>GodotCon Brussels 2019</h3>

		<img src="/storage/app/media/events/godotcon-2019/godotcon_brussels_banner_2019.png" alt="GodotCon Brussels 2019 banner">

		<p>Like the past two years, we're taking the opportunity that many community members flock to Brussels for <a href="#fosdem">FOSDEM 2019</a> to organize our own <em>Godot Conference</em> right after it. There will be talks and workshops given by engine users and developers, and plenty of time to discuss with each other and play Godot-made games.</p>
		
		<p>A Call for Proposals will be posted soon, and speakers will be announced in late December or January.</p>

		<p>This is an event for you (and us) to meet together and get to strengthen the existing bonds between Godot contributors and users. Everyone is welcome to join, and the entrance will be free. Even if you aren't familiar with Godot Engine yet, this can be a nice opportunity to discover a great game engine and an even greater community!</p>

		<p>The venue is yet to be determined, but it will be in Brussels, just like FOSDEM.</p>

		<p>To spread the word about the event, you can use the <a href="/storage/app/media/events/godotcon-2019/godotcon_brussels_banner_2019.png">GodotCon Brussels 2019 banner</a>.</p>
